Schedule Module - API Endpoints

This module organizes the different components of the gym scheduling system:
- Gym operating hours (regular weekly template and special day exceptions)
- Class definitions and categories
- Class sessions and scheduling
- Member participation and attendance tracking

The schedule system is divided into two main components:
1. Regular Hours (/gym-hours/regular): The weekly template defining standard operating hours 
   for each day of the week (Monday through Sunday)
2. Special Days (/gym-hours/special-days): Exceptions to the regular schedule for specific 
   dates like holidays, special events, or temporary changes

The gym-hours module also provides functionality to:
- Apply regular hours to a date range (/gym-hours/apply-defaults)
- Get effective hours for a specific date (/gym-hours/date/{date})
- Get schedules for a date range (/gym-hours/date-range)

The endpoints are organized in a modular structure with separate files
for each functional area, improving maintainability and separation of concerns.
