"""
Trainer-Member Relationship Module - API Endpoints

This module manages the relationships between trainers and members in the gym system.
It provides functionality for:

- Creating and managing trainer-member assignments
- Listing members assigned to specific trainers
- Listing trainers assigned to specific members
- Accessing relationship details for both roles

The relationship system is designed to support various training scenarios, including:
- One trainer with multiple members (standard personal training)
- One member with multiple trainers (specialized training in different areas)
- Administrative oversight of all relationships

Each endpoint is protected with appropriate permission scopes to ensure data security
and proper access control based on user roles.
